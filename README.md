# learnallureNG
this is an experiment project for myself to leran how to use allure framework and jenkins,

also including ant, maven and other relative tools.

I have to state that all the codes and settings come from all kinds of network resources.

And the target is to help me understand the keypoints of allure framework and other tools.
